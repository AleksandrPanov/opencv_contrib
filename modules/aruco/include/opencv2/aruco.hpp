/**
 * @defgroup aruco ArUco Marker Detection
 * This module is dedicated to square fiducial markers (also known as Augmented Reality Markers)
 * These markers are useful for easy, fast and robust camera pose estimation.ç
 *
 * The main functionalities are:
 * - Detection of markers in an image
 * - Pose estimation from a single marker or from a board/set of markers
 * - Detection of ChArUco board for high subpixel accuracy
 * - Camera calibration from both, ArUco boards and ChArUco boards.
 * - Detection of ChArUco diamond markers
 * The samples directory includes easy examples of how to use the module.
 *
 * The implementation is based on the ArUco Library by R. Muñoz-Salinas and S. Garrido-Jurado @cite Aruco2014.
 *
 * Markers can also be detected based on the AprilTag 2 @cite wang2016iros fiducial detection method.
